LR1O Instruction Placeholder
============================

Purpose
-------
Define and track LR1O (R1 row button B0) behavior: open a minimal popup window at 50% screen size with a single button labeled XR11O.

Current Behavior (agreed)
+-------------------------
+- On click, preventDefault/stopPropagation.
+- Opens a new window sized to 50% of available screen width/height.
+- Window features: no toolbar, no location bar, no menubar, no status bar, no scrollbars; resizable allowed.
+- Layout: matches R1 panel structure exactly:
+  * panel-header with "R3 - Piano Groups Blank Window" and timestamp (same style as R1 header)
+  * panel-body with XR1O button centered directly below
+- Button: labeled "XR1O" (singular), styled to match main frames (padding 2px 6px, font-size 0.7rem, #eee background, #ccc border, #ddd hover).
+- Timestamp format: YY.MM.DD • HH.MM (matches integration.html timestamp format).
+- Logging: console log in popup ("XR1O window ready") and log in opener with row/size; handles popup-blocker gracefully.

Discussion Checklist (future changes)
-------------------------------------
1) Should XR11O perform any action (e.g., send data back, close window, trigger R3/R2B)?
2) Do we need to pass row/chord data into the popup?
3) Should multiple LR1O windows be allowed (per-row naming) or single instance?
4) Any security constraints (noopener/noreferrer) needed beyond current feature set?
5) Accessibility: aria-labels for XR11O button, focus management on open.
6) Close behavior: manual only vs. auto-close after action.

Open Questions
--------------
- What should XR11O actually do when clicked?
- Should the popup receive context (row, chord value)?
- Should we block multiple popups or reuse one instance?

Decision Log
------------
- 2026-01-25: Initial implementation: popup window 50% screen, single XR11O button, no further behavior.

Action Items
------------
- Decide XR11O button behavior and data flow.
- Add aria-label/focus handling if needed.
- If behavior defined, update integration.html and specs accordingly.
- Add tests/manual steps for popup-blocker scenarios.
