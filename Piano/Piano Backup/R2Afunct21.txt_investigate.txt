== Start R1 ===		 

Updated Instructions for R1 – Pianoackord (Left Frame)
Purpose:
Displays chords or text data that are automatically populated by B5 from R2A.
If valid chords are input and validated via B5 in R2A, they are automatically loaded into R1.
If no valid chords are present in R2A, no data is loaded into R1, and the form remains blank.
Allows for manual chord entry or editing by the user after loading data from R2A.
Components:
a0. Text Form (Populated by B5 in R2A):
Functionality:
This text form receives valid chords from R2A when the B5 button is clicked in R2A.
If no valid chords exist in R2A, the field remains blank.
Editable:
Users can manually edit or add new chords after the text form is populated.
Example: User may add additional chords such as G7 A# after chords like C Dm E are auto-filled.
Visual feedback:
Display a message in R1 when B5 successfully transfers data (e.g., "Chords loaded from R2A").
Highlight invalid or missing chords in R2A (e.g., by showing an alert or error message in R2A before transferring to R1).
a. Manual Chord Input Field:
Functionality: Provides an input field where users can enter their own chords manually in case no chords from R2A are loaded or if they wish to make additions.
Validation Rules:
Ensure valid chord notations (e.g., C, G7, Fmaj7, A#, etc.).
Invalid entries should not be permitted; display an error message, such as "Invalid chord! Please use a valid notation like C or G7."
Behavior:
If a user clicks B2 ("Reset input"), the text input is cleared entirely, whether it's auto-filled by B5 or entered by the user.
b. B1 – OK Button:
Label: "OK".
Functionality: Takes the currently entered chord data in the text input (a) and loads it into R3 (Chord List Panel).
Behavior:
If the text input is empty or has invalid chords, display an error message: "No valid chords to load into R3."
Else, display a success message (e.g., "Chords successfully loaded into R3.").
Input Source: Manually entered chords in a, and optionally, valid chords filled by B5 (R2A).
c. B2 – Reset Button:
Label: "X".
Functionality: Clears only the text input field (a).
Behavior:
Resets any current input/chord data in the input field.
Displays feedback to the user, such as "Field cleared."
d. B3 – OK Button:
Label: "OK".
Functionality: Loads all valid chords present in the text form from R1 into the R3 Chord List Panel.
Includes both:
Any data automatically received from R2A via B5.
Manually entered data in this field.
Displays feedback: "All R1 data successfully loaded into R3."
e. B4 – Reset All Button:
Label: "X".
Functionality: Clears everything in R1, including:
Text input field.
Auto-filled chords from R2A.
Chord data or any state currently displayed in R1.
Feedback: Upon clicking, the user sees a confirmation message: "R1 cleared and reset."
f. Helptext Section:
Instructions displayed in R1 to guide users:
Chord Naming Rules:
Use uppercase letters for chord names.
Separate chords with spaces (e.g., "C G7 Em A#").
User Prompt for R2A Interaction:
Clearly indicate: “Chords will be displayed here once validated (B5 button in R2A).”
Provide an example for reference: "C G7 Dm7 F A# Bbm"
After pressing B1 (OK) or B3 (OK), successfully added chords will appear in R3.
Clarifications:
Button Naming Adjustments:

It would be ideal to avoid naming B1 and B3 both "OK" to reduce confusion.
Suggested B1: "Load Chord to R3."
Suggested B3: "Submit All to R3."
Interaction Linking Between R1 and R2A:

Ensure R2A’s B5 button has a JavaScript function attached to send any valid chord notations from R2A to R1’s auto-filled field (a0).
If no valid chords are detected, the transfer function should not update the input field—but display an error message (e.g., "No valid chords detected in R2A").
Distinct Functionality for B3 and B1:

Ensure B3 operates on all R1’s data, including data auto-filled from R2A and manually entered by the user in the text input.
Final Layout in ASCII:
Code
+-------------------+
|        R1         |  <-- (Piano Entry Panel. Spans Height)
|   - Chords from   |
|     R2A a0        |
| - Text Input (a)  |
| - [B1: OK]        |
| - [B2: X]         |
| - [B3: OK (Load)] |
| - [B4: X (Reset)] |
| - Help Text       |
+-------------------+
Key Adjustments:
Link between B5 (R2A) and a0 in R1 must be clear, and integration should be implemented in the workflow.
Label updates for the buttons to ensure each action is distinct and intuitive for the user.
Implement error handling and automated feedback for smoother user experience.
Let me know if there’s anything else that needs revision, clarification, or further detail!

=== Implement Missinf Functionalities ===

Missing Features You Need to Implement with JavaScript:
Button functionalities (e.g., Load, Reset, Reset All, Analyze, Play Chord).
Chord validation logic and error feedback for invalid entries.
Dynamic generation of chord lists in R3.
Interactive piano functionality in R2B for highlighting and playbacks.
Real-time chord analysis and updates in R2B.

==== Action Required Below =====
## Inversion Logic and Playback

### Inversion Logic
Inversion logic allows for the generation of distinct voicings by rearranging the notes of a chord. By moving the root note to another position within the chord, alternative harmonic structures can be produced. This technology is particularly essential for creating variations of chords such as:
- **Root Position:** No inversions.
- **First Inversion:** Root note is moved to the top of the chord.
- **Second Inversion:** The second note is moved to the top of the chord.
- Example: C Major (C-E-G) becomes:
  - Root Position: C, E, G
  - First Inversion: E, G, C
  - Second Inversion: G, C, E

**Panels Associated:**
- **R1 (Piano Entry Panel):** Manual entry of chords with inversion possibilities.
- **R3 (Chord List Panel):** Includes buttons for different inversions (B9).
- **R2B (Chord Analysis Panel):** Highlights keys and displays notes for the chosen inversion.

### Playback Feature
Real-time playback allows users to hear the chords, individual notes, or chord sequences they input or generate:
- **Play Chord Button (B10):** Upon clicking, the system generates audio for the suggested chord or inversion.
- **Interactive Keyboard:** Users can manually interact with the virtual 2-octave piano on-screen to play individual notes.

**Panels Associated:**
- **R1 (Piano Entry Panel):** Sends the chord data for playback upon clicking the "OK" or "Load" button.
- **R2A (Text Input Panel):** Valid chord data from text input can be sent for playback.
- **R2B (Chord Analysis Panel):** Displays the visual and interactive playback of the selected chord.

6 Change as required
6.a R1 – Pianoackord (Left Frame)
Missing functionality to send validated and entered chord data to R3 on button actions (e.g., "OK" or "Load").
"Reset All" button does not reset the entire R1 section (including help text or other related areas).

=== Additional functionality ====

Implement chord analysis functionality (e.g., detecting notes, displaying chord type).
Implement playback for both individual notes and chords via the Web Audio API.
Populate R3 dynamically based on the input and manage button functionality (Triad, Tetrad, Inversion/ALT).
Add error handling feedback within the UI directly (e.g., show errors near corresponding buttons or text fields).
