You’re right: don’t force one layout for all devices. Keep separate entry pages and route users based on device width.

Recommended plan (safe + clear):

Keep desktop as main (unchanged).
Create two separate entry pages:
tablet version
mobile version
Auto‑redirect from a small launcher page based on screen width:
Desktop → desktop page
Tablet → tablet page
Mobile → mobile page
Test each page separately before merging.
Merge only when all 3 pages work.
If you want, I can set up:

a device launcher page
separate tablet/mobile HTML files
clean routing with no layout conflicts

Understood. Keep desktop stable on main and do tablet/mobile work only on dev.

Workflow:

Desktop (stable): stay on main
git checkout main

Tablet/Mobile (dev work): switch to dev
git checkout dev


Test desktop only on main. When ready to work on tablet/mobile, switch to dev.
