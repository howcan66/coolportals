## Inversion Logic and Playback

### Inversion Logic
Inversion logic allows for the generation of distinct voicings by rearranging the notes of a chord. By moving the root note to another position within the chord, alternative harmonic structures can be produced. This technology is particularly essential for creating variations of chords such as:
- **Root Position:** No inversions.
- **First Inversion:** Root note is moved to the top of the chord.
- **Second Inversion:** The second note is moved to the top of the chord.
- Example: C Major (C-E-G) becomes:
  - Root Position: C, E, G
  - First Inversion: E, G, C
  - Second Inversion: G, C, E

**Panels Associated:**
- **R1 (Piano Entry Panel):** Manual entry of chords with inversion possibilities.
- **R3 (Chord List Panel):** Includes buttons for different inversions (B9).
- **R2B (Chord Analysis Panel):** Highlights keys and displays notes for the chosen inversion.

### Playback Feature
Real-time playback allows users to hear the chords, individual notes, or chord sequences they input or generate:
- **Play Chord Button (B10):** Upon clicking, the system generates audio for the suggested chord or inversion.
- **Interactive Keyboard:** Users can manually interact with the virtual 2-octave piano on-screen to play individual notes.

**Panels Associated:**
- **R1 (Piano Entry Panel):** Sends the chord data for playback upon clicking the "OK" or "Load" button.
- **R2A (Text Input Panel):** Valid chord data from text input can be sent for playback.
- **R2B (Chord Analysis Panel):** Displays the visual and interactive playback of the selected chord.
